Model Architecture
Base Model: Random Forest Regressor

Rationale: Random Forest is a powerful ensemble method that can handle complex relationships and is less prone to overfitting compared to simpler models like linear regression.
Hyperparameters:

n_estimators: Number of decision trees in the forest.
max_depth: Maximum depth of each decision tree.
min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.   
Training Process
Data Preprocessing:

Loading: Load the housing data from the CSV file housing.new.
Handling Missing Values: Fill missing values with a suitable strategy (e.g., forward fill).
Feature Engineering: Consider creating new features if necessary (e.g., combining features, calculating ratios).
Encoding Categorical Variables: Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Standardize numerical features to a common scale.
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
Model Training:

Instantiate the Random Forest Regressor with selected hyperparameters.
Train the model on the training data using the fit() method.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use techniques like grid search or randomized search to find optimal hyperparameter values.
Evaluate different combinations of hyperparameters based on a chosen metric (e.g., mean squared error).
Usage Instructions
Install Required Libraries:

Install necessary Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
Prepare Data:

Ensure your housing data is in a CSV file named housing.new with columns: longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, and median_house_value.   
If necessary, preprocess the data as described in the training process.
Load the Model:

Load the trained model from a saved file (e.g., using joblib or pickle).
Make Predictions:

Prepare new data with the same features as the training data.
Preprocess the new data using the same steps as the training data.
Use the predict() method of the loaded model to make predictions on the new data.
Additional Notes
Evaluation Metrics: Consider using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a production environment for real-time predictions.
Continuous Improvement: Regularly retrain the model with new data to ensure its accuracy and adapt to changing market conditions.
